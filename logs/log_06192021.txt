*******   Updates


1. Calculated the sum of all A00100 and N1 categories (1-6), and A00100 per N1 (division of two sums)

2. Converted 7 categories to 6. Specifically, for year 2006, 2007 and 2008, agi_class ranges from 1 to 7.
Per SOI data documentation, 1+2 (7 categories) == 1 (6 categories)

3. Added one function named append_all() - append all years into one single data file "SOI05to18.csv"
